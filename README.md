Hello everyone! Welcome to my GitHub!</br>
I'm a 16 year old game developer from Italy (Milan) 🤌.

Other than gamedev I sometimes do Malwares... Don't worry though! I only do those for learning something new, and would ~~maybe~~ never use them against someone. </br>
I know pretty well this programming languages:
```
Python
GML
C++
Shell
```

If you want to have a talk with me you can find me on discord! ``j o s h u a#0072``
